The following frameworks have been tested with AWS Elastic Beanstalk:\r\n\r\n- Flask 0.9\r\n- Flask 0.8\r\n\r\nStep 1: Initialize Your Git Repository\r\n------\r\nEb is a command line interface that enables you to deploy applications quickly and more easily using Git. Eb is available as part of the Elastic Beanstalk command line tools package. Follow the steps below to install eb and initialize your Git repository.\r\n\r\nTo install eb, its prerequisite software, and initialize your Git repository\r\n\r\n1. Install the following software onto your local computer:\r\n\r\n  a. Linux/Unix/MAC\r\n\r\n    - Download and unzip the Elastic Beanstalk command line tools package at the AWS Sample Code & Libraries website. You can install either version 2.6.0 or version 2.6.1 of the AWS DevTools. Version 2.6.0 uses Ruby. Version 2.6.1 uses Python.\r\n\r\n    - Git 1.6.6 or later. To download Git, go to http://git-scm.com/.\r\n\r\n    - Ruby version 1.8.7 or later. To view and download Ruby clients, go to http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/.\r\n\r\n    - Python 2.7 or 3.0.\r\n\r\n  b. Windows\r\n\r\n    - Download and unzip the Elastic Beanstalk command line tools package at the AWS Sample Code & Libraries website.\r\n\r\n    - Git 1.6.6 or later. To download Git, go to http://git-scm.com/.\r\n\r\n    - PowerShell 2.0.\r\n\r\n        Note:  Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 come with PowerShell 2.0. If you are running an earlier version of Windows, you can download PowerShell 2.0. Visit http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx for more details.\r\n\r\n2. Initialize your Git repository.\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  git init .\r\n  '''\r\n\r\nStep 2: Configure AWS Elastic Beanstalk\r\n------\r\n\r\nYou use eb, a command line tool, to configure AWS Elastic Beanstalk. If you haven't already installed eb on your local computer, do that now at the AWS Sample Code & Libraries website. If you are running eb on a Linux operating system, you will need to install Python 2.7 or 3.0.\r\n\r\nBefore you use eb, set your PATH to the location of eb. The following table shows an example for Linux/UNIX and Windows.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
